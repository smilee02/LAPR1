# Modelling the Evolution of a Species

## Objectives

The aim of this project is for students to develop an application in the Java language (Horstmann, 2015) in which they apply a basic process for developing computer applications, valuing all phases of the development cycle, from analysis and design to validation tests.
In particular, in the project to be carried out this academic year, the aim is for students to study a model for predicting the evolution of species and develop an application that implements this model and allow any biologist to study the evolution of a given species.

## Modelling the Evolution of a Species

Over the years, various mathematical models have been proposed with the aim of predicting the evolution of certain species.
The simplest population model was introduced by Lotka in 1920 and formalised by Leslie (Leslie, 1945) twenty years later, is based on mortality and fertility rates for different age intervals.

## Installation

- la4j JAR (It is already in the Repo)
- gnuplot.exe (Needed to install on default Path C:\Program Files\gnuplot\bin\gnuplot.exe)

## Running

The file to be run is LAPR1.java
Can be run Interactive way, Non Interactive.

## Alterations

The program has been altered regarding the language. The language has been changed to English (UK). Originally it was in Portuguese.

## Contributing

You are free to contribute to this project and improve it. It was the first ever project built in a team so there might be a lot of problems that I probably will not fix.
